Moomla - Admin Panel for e-commerce.

Exam project for course "JavaScript Web Application Development" in IT-Academy

An attempt to create a control panel for an online store. Not all functionality works, not all features have been implemented. However, the main task was completed, namely, the characteristics of the goods. The process of creating characteristics, as well as the general functionality of the store, were borrowed from JoomShopping.
